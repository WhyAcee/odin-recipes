    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p1>Simple roast turkey just like grandma used to 
        make. Seasoned with salt and pepper and basted 
        with turkey stock, the flavors of the turkey 
        really stand out. Stuff with your favorite 
        dressing.</p1>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (18 pound) whole turkey</li>
        <li>8 cups prepared stuffing</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ quarts turkey stock, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F 
            (165 degrees C). Place a rack in the 
            lowest position of the oven.</li>
        <li>Remove turkey neck and giblets. Rinse 
            turkey and pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Place turkey, breast-side up, on a 
            rack in a roasting pan. Loosely fill 
            turkey cavity with stuffing. Rub skin 
            with butter, then season with salt and 
            pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour 2 cups of turkey stock into the 
            roasting pan. Loosely tent turkey with 
            aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Roast turkey for 2 1/2 hours, basting 
            with pan juices every 30 minutes. When 
            drippings evaporate, add remaining stock 
            to the pan, 1 to 2 cups at a time.</li>
        <li>Remove foil and continue roasting until 
            a meat thermometer inserted in thickest 
            part of thigh reads 165 degrees F 
            (75 degrees C), about 1 1/2 hours 
            more.</li>
        <li>Transfer turkey to a large serving 
            platter. Let stand for 20 to 30 
            minutes before carving.</li>
    </ol>
